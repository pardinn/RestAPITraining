# Rest API Training

Studying Rest API Automation with Rest Assured.  

All knowledge was taken from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-automation/?src=sac&kw=rest).

In order for this to work, you need to rename the `configTemplate.properties` file as `config.properties`.
In that file, you should fill the key=value pairs with your own keys.

## For Google API key
You can create a Google API key at the following location:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start

From there, you should see a button called "Get a key" on top right.
You'll have to enable your key on all APIs being interacted with in this project

## For Twitter API keys
You can create your Twitter key at the following location:
https://apps.twitter.com

You'll need to create a new app (if you don't have one for your account already).
After that, you'll need to generate an Access Token for you.
Once you've done all of this, you should have the API Key, API Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret.
